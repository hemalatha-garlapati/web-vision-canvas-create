Hack-4-Mini 2.0 Theme:HealthTech And Bioinformatics Problem statement: Gene Expression Explorer:Use NCBI’s public GEO repository to analyze biomedical data.For example,select a microarray or RNA-seq dataset comparing healthy vs disease samples and build a classifier or visualization.teams might use Python libraries(Pandas,Scipy) find differentially expressed genes and present a simple web interface where users can query genes of intrest.This project leverages open genomics data for a bilogically meaningful analysis. Solution: Here's how to explain your "Gene Expression Explorer" project to panel members in about a minute: Gene Expression Explorer: 1-Minute Pitch "Our project, 'Gene Expression Explorer,' leverages vast public genomic datasets, specifically from NCBI GEO, to understand how gene activity differs between healthy and diseased states. The core idea is to take raw gene expression data – think microarrays or RNA-seq – and through Python libraries like Pandas and SciPy, identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These are the genes whose activity significantly changes in disease, potentially acting as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. For instance, we can analyze a dataset comparing, say, healthy lung tissue to cancerous lung tissue. Our analysis pinpoints the genes that are abnormally high or low in cancer. To make this accessible, we've built a simple web interface where users can input a gene of interest and instantly see its expression pattern in our analyzed datasets. This project not only demonstrates our ability to handle and analyze large-scale biomedical data but also provides a user-friendly tool for researchers to quickly gain biologically meaningful insights, ultimately aiding in understanding disease mechanisms and guiding further research."
